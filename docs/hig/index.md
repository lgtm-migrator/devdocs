# Introduction

## Human Interface Guidelines

The Human Interface Guidelines are the primary source of design documentation for those creating software designed for tauOS.

### Under Construction

These guidelines are still a living document and may experience rapid changes. For sections that have not yet been written, please refer to [The GNOME HIG](https://developer.gnome.org/hig).

### Contribute

The [HIG project](https://github.com/tau-OS/hig-docs) is available for changes on the [tauOS Github](https://github.com/tau-OS).
