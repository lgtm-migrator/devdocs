# Chips

![Chips](/assets/chips.png)

Chips help people with entering information, making selections, filtering content, or triggering actions. And they taste great, mmm BBQ flavour.

Chips can show multiple interactive elements together in the same area, such as a list of selectable movie times, or a series of email contacts.

Chips use tags or descriptive words to filter content. They can be a good alternative to toggles or checkboxes.
