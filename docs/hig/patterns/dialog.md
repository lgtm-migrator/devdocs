Dialogs interrupt users with urgent information, details, or actions. Common usage includes confirming a destructive action, or informing the user of something instantly.

- A dialog should not exceed 400 units in width and height.

- A dialog is modal with the Window, and displays a scrim behind it.

- A dialog fades in, and scales up from 80% to 100% (its final size.) A background scrim fades in, in front of app content.

- A dialog stays in focus and does not scroll until the user has dismissed or gone through with its associated confirmation.

- A dialog should not contain, or make happen, scrollable contents.
