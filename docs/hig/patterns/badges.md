# Badges

![](/assets/badges.png)

Badges are a small visual interaction with the user that aims to inform them of something, without using more than a colored dot.
It should not be larger than 16 by 16 pixels. Optionally one can display a number but only in Notifier Badges.

There are three types:

1. Notifier Badge

    This type of badge notifies the user that something happened elsewhere in the app. Use it sparingly.

2. Modifier Badge

    This type of badge shows the status of something, like for example a modified file in a project.

3. Classifier Badge

    This type of badge displays the availability of someone or something. Pairs well with account widgets.
