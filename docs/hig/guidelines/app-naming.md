# App Naming

App names are an essential part of the user experience. Not only do they hold the role of what an app does, they establish character. The size and shape of app names also should be of equal importance for aesthetic purposes.

Naming isn't an easy game, and these guidelines don't try to be a one-size-fits-all solution. But, they do provide details on how to best name your app.

## Do's and Do Not's

Do:
- Be related to the app’s domain (for example: Lumiere for a video app)
- Be short (less than 15 characters).
- Be easy to pronounce.
- Use header capitalization (for example: Icon Preview instead of Icon preview).

Don't:
- Using trademarks or names of other projects (for example: tauOS Instant Video.)
- Having a “t” prefix (for example: tMusic.)
- Overly complicated names and/or acronyms.
- Puns and inside jokes.

## Choosing a Name

This following process helps select a good name:

1. **Brainstorm**

    First, generate ideas for your app name. One way to do this is to write down all the words from your app’s domain.

2. **Come up with a shortlist**

    Once you have a long list of names, sort through them and identify the strongest candidates.

3. **Do a little bit of manual SEO**

    Search the web to see if any of your names are already in use. If they are, discard them.

4. **A winner is born**

    Once you have a shortlist of viable names, just select one.
